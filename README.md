# NeuralNetwork
I have implemented a Neural Network from scratch following the book [Make Your Own Neural Network](https://www.amazon.com/Make-Your-Own-Neural-Network-ebook/dp/B01EER4Z4G). 
The book has all the details about how a Neural Network actually works. At the heart of a neural network

Running step
1. Put train and test data in  ~/mnist_dataset/ directory from dataset directory. So after copying the folder will have mnist_train_100.csv and mnist_test_10.csv files.
2. install anaconda from [here](https://docs.continuum.io/anaconda/)
3. Load the NeuralNetwork.ipynb to python 3 note in anaconda.
4. Click run button and the code will be going through each code blocks.
5. For details read the book.
